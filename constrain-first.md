Constraint-First Prompting

Google Brain researchers start with constraints before the actual task.

Template:

HARD CONSTRAINTS (cannot be violated):
- [constraint 1]
- [constraint 2]
- [constraint 3]

SOFT PREFERENCES (optimize for these):
- [preference 1]
- [preference 2]

TASK: [your actual request]

Confirm you understand all constraints before proceeding.

---

Example:

HARD CONSTRAINTS (cannot be violated):
- Must be written in Rust
- Cannot use any external dependencies
- Must compile on stable Rust 1.75+
- Maximum binary size: 5MB

SOFT PREFERENCES (optimize for these):
- Fast compilation time
- Minimal memory allocation

TASK: Write a CLI tool that parses 10GB CSV files and outputs JSON with schema validation

Confirm you understand all constraints before proceeding.
